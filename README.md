# Stock Analysis and Crossover Trading Algorithm
The Notebook "Stock Market Analysis" follows along with the blog [An Introduction to Stock Market Data Analysis with Python (Part 1)](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/introduction-stock-market-data-python-1/) and [Part 2](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/introduction-stock-market-data-python-2/). I added many of my own visualizations and code improvements.  

I test and analyze the algorithm in bulk in the Notebook "Stock Trading Algorithm Testing".
